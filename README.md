# DM_Golem

This is a simple bot that will roll dice at first, but maybe some day it will do more.

Run this commaned `npm install discord.io winston --save` to install the packages you need. 

If you run into a problem where the bot runs and nothing happens, you might be pointed at a discord gateway that is discontinued. In order to get around that, I ran this instead `npm install woor/discord.io#gateway_v6 winston --save`.
